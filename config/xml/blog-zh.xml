				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’ve just finished running a successful marketing campaign or have just come back from a successful event, chances are, you now have new leads for your shop. What’s next? Do you email them? What do you say? Today we’ll help you figure just what to do with them to improve your lead retention.<br />
<span id="more-20933"></span></p>
<h2>1. Qualify Leads</h2>
<p>The first step following lead acquisition is to qualify your leads. Where you did you acquire them from? Where are they currently in the purchase funnel? Three sample categories include: don&#8217;t know the brand, love the brand but haven&#8217;t purchased, new customer. By categorizing your leads, you’ll be able to craft a marketing message that is not only more relevant, but also engaging. </p>
<p>If customers just learned about your brand, they probably aren&#8217;t interested in all the updates you’ve made to an older version of your product. They don’t even know what your product was like before! Misaligned emails can also befuddle your existing customers. For example, sending an old customer a new campaign about your company might lead them to believe you’re changing your company. It’s why we highlight the importance of knowing exactly who you are talking to, so you can maximize the impact of the messages you send. </p>
<h2>2. Activation / Reactivation Campaign</h2>
<p>If you’re targeting those who don’t know your brand, your first step should be introducing them to what you sell. By aligning your message with the right audience, you increase the chances of retaining your customer longer. These activation campaigns aim to get customers interested in your brand and hopefully even engage your company. </p>
<p>If you’re leads are already customers, your goal is to get them to convert again, preferably in the form of a new purchase. If they purchased from you before, give them an incentive to make a purchase. As an added bonus for you, try to get feedback from customers by asking them to complete a survey. Once they provide feedback, they’ll be rewarded with a coupon to shop your site. </p>
<h2>3. Engagement Campaign</h2>
<p>Sometimes customers just aren’t ready to convert. Don&#8217;t discount these leads! Just because they haven’t made a purchase, it doesn’t mean they’re not interested in your business. Keep in touch with your customers by sending regular updates about your products or the latest trends in your industry. This is especially important during low sales seasons when other companies may not be engaging your customers.</p>
<p>Selling pet supplies? Touch base with pet lovers on days like National Dog Day or during <a href="http://www.dogtipper.com/fun/pet-holidays" target="_blank">related events</a> like <a href="http://www.crufts.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crufts</a>. It’s time to get creative to engage customers. There is no wrong or right approach, it’s all about building a relationship with your customers. </p>
<h2>4. Convert <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/respond-customer-feedback-boost-business/" style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', Tahoma,Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:28px;font-weight: 300">Complaints</a> into Hot Leads</h2>
<p>Hearing from customers is always a good thing, even in the form of angry <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/3-must-follow-rules-for-addressing-your-online-stores-customer-complaints/">customers complaining</a>. Every interaction or touch point of your brand is an opportunity to make a positive impact on your customers. If you can win them over when they are most upset with you, keeping them around will be a piece of cake. </p>
<p>First, listen carefully to customer concerns. They’re taking time to tell you about their problem, so give the courtesy of hearing them out. Stay objective by focusing on the facts and not on emotions. Next, try to find a resolution that works for both you and the customer. Try to deliver the solution in a timely fashion. For some examples and more tips on handling customer complaints, check out these ideas for <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/respond-customer-feedback-boost-business/">how to respond to customer feedback</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Run personalized campaigns</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a new batch of hot leads, there’s still something you can do to re-engage your audience. Most merchants only target customers during major holidays sales, as the majority of people tend to shop at this time. However, there’s a way to keep customers engaged throughout the year, specifically, one special day of the year for each of your customer &#8211; their birthday!</p>
<p>Birthdays are spread throughout the year, so you can kick off this campaign at anytime. Birthdays are about the customer, not you &#8211; so tailor your messages with that in mind. Try messages built on the idea of a birthday gift. Whether you offer a special discount code (like “MYBIRTHDAY” or a birthday gift card, this gesture (although generic) has the ability to feel very personal. </p>
<h2>It’s your turn</h2>

<li>Qualify your leads</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is upon us. You’ve decked out your homepage, planned your holiday promotions and set up a targeted communication plan to draw a maximum number of shoppers. This is the biggest revenue-generating time of the year after all. But what if, despite your greatest efforts, you don’t see an uptick in sales by early December? Don’t worry, all hope is not lost. We’ve put together a few technical tips to help you determine what might be going wrong on your site and a few marketing actions to boost sales.<br />
<span id="more-20920"></span><br />
<strong>Check on site speed.</strong> This is a busy time of year and shoppers are less patient than usual (which isn’t saying much). If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, this could explain why you’re losing shoppers before check out. Make sure photos are optimized for the web. Get in touch with your hosting provider to let them know you’re expecting an uptick in traffic and <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/432-website-performance" target="_blank">make sure a simple technical glitch isn’t standing between you and out-of-the-park sales</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Identify problem pages.</strong> Use Google Analytics to identify 404 Error Pages that may be scaring away customers. Review your 404 Error message and make sure it’s reassuring, not cryptic and worrisome. Customers need to be assured they’re still on your site and not opening themselves up to viruses and malware.</p>
<p><strong>Verify your Adwords account.</strong> If you’re using paid advertising, double check your keywords, make sure everything is headed in the right direction. Since it’s the holidays, you might want to transfer budget to large cities that are commerce hubs, or specific customer segments. Just make sure everything is setup correctly, as a technical error could be what’s affecting your sales.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate recent changes.</strong> If you’re not seeing traffic increase, or worse, you’re seeing a decrease during the holidays, take a minute to evaluate any changes you’ve made. You probably redid your homepage for the holidays and updated product pages. Did you overlook any important elements, like call to action buttons? Did you add complications to the sales funnel? Are your special offers and purchase triggers like free shipping clearly displayed on your site? Take time to analyze how your changes may have impacted traffic. </p>
<p><strong>Stay on top of suppliers.</strong> Ideally this is something you addressed before the holiday season got underway. If a main supplier encounters a problem that interrupts or slows production, that then becomes your problem. Try to diversify your suppliers so you’re not dependent on just one. This will keep you nimble during the holiday rush. Also, stay on top of your suppliers. Late deliveries could leave you with excess stock that could force you to take post-holiday markdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Update content.</strong> You should have holiday-themed blog posts up or ready to go. Have you embedded links back to your bestsellers in them? You should have. Review your homepage and product pages and spruce up content by adding synonyms and keywords customers are searching for. Consider creating or updating a gift guide. These simplify the shopping experience and let you put your bestsellers front and center. </p>
<p><strong>Reach out to local press.</strong> National print magazines have already moved on to planning January and February issues, but you might have a shot at getting some coverage in your local news outlets, which could give you added visibility when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Get serious on social.</strong> Social media is a great tool to boost holiday sales. Try offering a social-media only promotion or holding a contest online. You’ll have to make your deals incredibly tempting, but if you’ve got low-performing inventory you want to move, consider bundling it into gifts or offering a giveaway with a certain purchase level.</p>
<p><strong>Have communication ready in case of unforeseen events.</strong> Some things are simply out of your control: no one expects you to stop snowstorms or strikes. However, they do expect you to troubleshoot and communicate. Have an email ready to send explaining that you’re doing your best to work around whatever incident has arisen. You’ll be able to fill in a few more details just before you send it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sales process used to be fairly simple, generating data that was easy to visualize and track. But ecommerce changed all that. Today, an online purchase generates a storm of data that can be used to improve sales performance—if you know how to harness it. Large companies have understood this and invest in exploiting that data. Small businesses can reap the benefits from this information as well, although they have to be a bit more nimble in doing so, given their limited human and financial resources. Here are a few ideas for how small businesses can go beyond simply monitoring data and turn it into a competitive advantage, especially for identifying actions during key sales periods.<br />
<span id="more-20912"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Identify patterns</h2>
<p>Finding patterns in data starts with monitoring activity, but it doesn’t end there. The key to making the most of data is to look for patterns: What are your customers buying? How are they finding it? Are they coming back? How much are they spending? Can you get them to spend more, and more often? </p>
<p>It helps to think of sales and marketing processes in terms of funnels. You might send 1,000 emails for a campaign that result in 10 recipients buying something. What happens along the way and why, is crucial to helping you determine what to change in your process in order to better respond to your customers. </p>
<p>Here’s an example of a typical email campaign funnel:</p>
<ol>
<li>You send 1,000 past customers an email promoting your holiday sale.</li>
<li>Of the 1,000 sent, 980 are delivered by your email service.</li>
<li>Of the 980 delivered, 325 are opened by past customers.</li>
<li>Of the 325 opened, 40 click on a product link in the email.</li>
<li>Of the 40 that clicked, 35 add a product to their shopping cart.</li>
<li>Of the 35 that add products to their shopping cart, 8 follow through with the purchase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having data about each “narrowing” of the funnel helps you understand where problems may be occurring and where to focus your efforts and resources. </p>
<p>To a see a real shift in business requires consolidating the data gathered from monitoring, analyzing the results over time, and testing variations on strategy to see what happens. Any time is the perfect time to start gathering and analyzing data, but the holiday season is a particularly good time because it’s such a heavy-hitting time of year and ideally you’ll want to improve your performance each year. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Set goals</h2>
<p>It helps to have a goal in order to determine if what you’re doing is working and if it’s even right for your business. For example, are you trying to increase traffic? Boost sales? Reduce customer service calls? In order to test and monitor for these goals, you’ll want to establish a set of key performance indicators, or KPIs, to guide your analysis. Here are a few ideas to get you started thinking about what KPIs to focus on:</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase Site Traffic 25%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> site traffic, sources, click-through rates, social shares, bounce rates. </p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase Sales 10%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> Daily sales, conversion rate, site traffic</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase conversions 5%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> Conversion rate, shopping cart abandonment rate, competitive price trends. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Test your ideas</h2>
<p>Split testing is a small business owner’s best friend. Once you’ve decided what your goal is and what KPIs you’re going to focus on, you can start getting scientific about how you’re going to get there. Start by identifying different page layouts for product pages and split testing them to see what resonates most with your customers. You can do the same thing with email campaigns and social media projects. </p>
<p>Here are a few examples of things to test on your website: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Product images</li>
<li>Product descriptions</li>
<li>Call to action button text</li>
<li>Call to action button position</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Trends is a great place to start identifying what’s relevant in your market via the volume and popularity of searches in your field. This can inform your business from a supply and demand perspective, but also give you ideas for content and specific wording to test throughout your site, email campaigns and social media actions.</p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Tools and resources</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, okay, monitoring and analyzing is great, but how do I manage all that information? Google Analytics is a great place to start. You can run your split tests through their “experiments” function to see which changes work and which don’t. The results are not always what you’d expect, which is why it’s so interesting to perform this kind of test. Having <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/63-analytics-stats-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">all your data consolidated in one place</a> is also necessary if you’re going to draw any useful conclusions. </p>
<p>You should also think about how you’re going to divide your marketing budget between customer segments. While acquisition should be an important part of your marketing budget, returning customers are actually more valuable in the long run. They are more likely to refer your brand and draw viral attention to it. You can invest in them by sending simple gifts, getting in touch with them via phone or email, or following up with special offers or coupons. By dividing your customers into segments (returning and new) you can test these initiatives and see what spurs repeat spending and increased spending. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Social media</h2>
<p>Social media creates a lot of data, but it can be difficult to tell what is driving conversions and what is giving you longer term visibility without necessarily resulting in immediate conversions. Facebook Insights and a platform like Hootsuite for Twitter can help you get a handle on these numbers and evaluate your activities on social media. <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/39-social-commerce-facebook-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">The PrestaShop Addons marketplace features a variety of modules</a> designed to give merchants insight into their marketing efforts, including on social media. </p>
<p>Data can be an incredible competitive advantage for small businesses that understand how to use it. Setting goals, identifying KPIs and regularly testing are the first steps to better data management. Resources like Google Trends, Google Analytics and social media tools like Hootsuite all provide free or low-cost ways to manage data, so there’s no reason to wait to start gathering and analyzing your data! </p>

<span id="more-20903"></span><br />
Online stores conversions depend on many factors. The most important factor in the complex approach to conversion optimization is to squeeze the most from each and every one of these factors, minimizing the losses. Why is it so important?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, <a href="http://ow.ly/TCoYA" target="_blank">social media are an integral part of everyday life</a> for almost all (96%) marketing professionals, who use them for both personal and professional purposes. As a business, it is important to choose marketing channels such as social media that will provide you with the best results and good ROI.</p>
<p>Today, more and more small businesses are choosing social media over other marketing channels to help raise awareness of their brand, boost their sales and grow their professional network. Indeed, the figures for social media speak for themselves! Of the 3 billion people who use the Internet &#8211; i.e. 45% of the population &#8211; 2.1 billion have a social media account. There are 1.4 billion Facebook users and 248 million active Twitter users with 500 million tweets sent every day.*<br />
Another significant figure: the digital marketing budget of companies is expected to increase by 8% in 2015**.<br />
<span id="more-20883"></span><br />
But what about the things you <em>shouldn&#8217;t do</em>? Because make no mistake: some errors can be ruinous. Discover the 4 mistakes you absolutely must avoid when using social media for your business.</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">1. Not having a social media strategy</h2>
<p>Many companies start using social media without having guidelines or a strategy. Most importantly, lots of them have no idea of the stakes involved.</p>
<p>Why is this a mistake? Quite simply because every action taken on social media should correspond to a clear objective. If so, the rest of your social initiatives will be much easier to manage. If you don&#8217;t have a defined plan, these actions may not be clear or aligned with one another. The engagement of your subscribers and your ROI will be even more affected.</p>
<p>Does this seem complicated? Don&#8217;t worry! There are currently <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQ89" target="_blank">plans for creating social media strategies</a>. Think about your objectives, audit your social media sites, learn from the competition, <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQyP" target="_blank">create a content calendar</a> and lastly: test, test and test again in order to refine this strategy.</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">2. Buying &#8220;Likes&#8221; and subscribers</h2>
<p>On certain social media sites, you can buy &#8220;Likes&#8221; and subscribers. This technique was once widely used but is increasingly being criticized. Some brands prefer appealing to the “<a href="http://www.journaldunet.com/ebusiness/expert/57443/3-raisons-de-ne-pas-acheter-des-fans-facebook.shtml" target="_blank">social masses</a>”  but keep in mind that these fake &#8220;Likes&#8221; and phantom subscribers will have absolutely no impact on your results and will merely cause you to spend money. More importantly, the quality and interaction of your audience will decrease, your brand&#8217;s image will be tarnished and your ROI will be close to 0. If you want more interaction and subscribers, go with traditional solutions: word of mouth, competitions, contests, advertising, etc.</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">3. Posting too much content</h2>
<p>Posting content is a good strategy: it creates interaction in your accounts and provides your subscribers with information to which they will be receptive. However, if you post content too often, you may bore them in spite of their loyalty. You aren&#8217;t the only brand they follow and they won&#8217;t want or have time to digest this flow of information. In short, by posting too much content, you risk &#8220;spamming&#8221; your followers and therefore seeing them unsubscribe.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, create a <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQyP" target="_blank">content calendar</a> and stick to it. Be sure to post interesting and varied content that corresponds to the objective set for each social media site. Just the right amount of high-quality content is essential to the success of your social media strategy</p>
<h2 style="color:#706da4">4. Deleting negative comments</h2>
<p>The first reflex of beginners on social media sites is to delete injurious comments. Why leave such negative testimonials where everyone can see them? They&#8217;re sure to discredit you and directly affect your brand image. But think again: deleting them would be a big mistake! By doing so, you are showing everyone your guilt, sensitivity and lack of transparency. Consider these negative comments to be an opportunity: you can address them by satisfying an unhappy customer or solving a problem you might not even have been aware of, all while remaining in the public sphere. You will thus show everyone that you are professional and responsive. Even better: you can reply to these comments with some humor and thus turn the conversation to your advantage.</p>
<p>There are many other <a href="http://ow.ly/TCQLB" target="_blank">common strategic social media mistakes</a>, each one of which has a solution. What&#8217;s most important is that you have a strategy for your social media and know how to apply it. Of course, it&#8217;s easier to fall into traps when you&#8217;re just getting started on social media or are creating a new business and starting from scratch, but as the saying goes: &#8220;<em>don&#8217;t be afraid to make mistakes. Just don&#8217;t make the same mistake twice.</em>”</p>
